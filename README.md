# Beerig
Software developed to control Mixed machine ("Beerig")

The arduino software can be used and edited to add more drinks to the list.
The current list is a basic cocktail list that will work great for parties. 

The android application is meant to be run off of one main tabet to order drinks from.
Although this can be added to the app store to allow users to order off of a phone, we do not want
this ability at the moment.
